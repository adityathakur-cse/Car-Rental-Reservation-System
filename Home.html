                  <p class="leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">Believe it or not, a large quantity of food gets wasted even before it reaches the consumer’s plate. Right after harvest, the food 
                    commodities begin to deteriorate in quality if they are not handled properly. This includes poor transportation facilities, overloading in warehouses, the warehouses being 
                    maintained very poorly and finally improper handling during distribution.</p>

                  <h2 class="text-lg sm:text-xl text-gray-900 font-medium title-font mb-2">Lack of awareness :</h2>
                  <p class="leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">Be it eating from restaurants or at home, most people think it is okay to waste food because they have paid for it. Of course, the
                     restaurants or vendors will not be facing any loss as they are charging us, consumers, for the same, but the real cost is to the economy and the planet. The food that was
                      wasted because we couldn’t priorly plan if we could consume it or not; would land in the trash, thus not being of any use to anybody.</p>

                  <p class="leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">India is famously known for its ultra-grand weddings throwing extravagance wherever possible but what it is not known for is that
                     it is one of the leading causes of food wastage. Enormous amounts of food go to waste during such occasions. According to research, about 40% of the food prepared goes
                     to waste and is simply thrown away after the wedding ends.</p>

                  <p class="leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">One of the most problematic causes of food wastage these days is the usage of edible foods in markets such as Cosmetics, 
                    Healthcare etc., When the foods do not comply to the standards set by these markets they would straight up get rejected although they are perfectly edible. This
                     is a grave mistake that would cost the economy largely.</p>

                  <p class="leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">The leading consequence of food wastage on the country is its direct contribution to malnutrition and 
                    starvation. According to a report released by Feeding India, around 194.4 million people or 14.3% of the population are not receiving adequate nutrition. 
                    India is also ranked in the 107th position out of 121 countries in the Global Hunger Index, 2022.</p>

                    <p class="leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">Food waste is a major contributor to climate change. According to the Food and Agriculture 
                      Organization of the United Nations (FAO), food waste accounts for 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

                  <p class="leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">Food waste in India is not just a national issue; it also affects the planet on a large scale as food is a 
                    universal commodity and is not just restricted to people of a particular country. The environmental hazards associated with the wastage are also 
                    immense resulting in the emission of unnecessary carbon that could result in a devastating note. Food production and transportation contribute to
                     deforestation, habitat loss, and pollution. This can have a devastating impact on biodiversity, including the loss of endangered species.</p>

                  <h2 class="text-lg sm:text-xl text-gray-900 font-medium title-font mb-2">Economic Loss :</h2>
                    <p class="leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">In India, 40% of the food wasted is equivalent to nearly 89,000 crore/year. This is equivalent to nearly 
                    1% of the GDP which is depleted in the form of food wastage in India.
                    What might look like a harmless wastage of food deeply impacts the agricultural sector and affects the nation’s economy. We also need to keep in
                     mind that it is not just the food that is getting wasted but also all the resources such as water, land, energy and most importantly the hard
                      labour of the farmers and all the people involved in the production of food. This is the food wastage statistics in India.

                    Waste audits were carried out for one week at each store. Daily samples of food waste were collected, shorted and categorised.
                    The weight of each food type wasted was measured using a digital weighting scale. Food waste was classified into the following categories: 
                    Fruits, vegetables, bakery items, meat and seafood, diary and eggs, dry goods and prepared meals.</p>

                    The survey contained 10 questions on a 5 point likert scale covering topics such as food preparation habits, purchase planning, date label use and willingness to purchase imperfect products.
